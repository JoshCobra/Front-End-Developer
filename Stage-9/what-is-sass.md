# What is SASS?
Sass is a preprocessor scripting language that is interpreted or compiled into Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). SassScript is the scripting language itself. It provides mechanisms available in programming languages, like variables, nesting, and functions. These mechanisms allow for more concise and easier-to-read stylesheets, especially when working with large stylesheets.

### What are preprocessors?
Preprocessors are tools that allow you to write CSS in a more concise and powerful way. They extend the CSS language with features that are not available in CSS itself. Preprocessors make it easier to maintain and organize your stylesheets, and can also help you write more DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) code.
