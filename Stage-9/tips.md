2. **Advantages of using Preprocessors:**
    - Preprocessors provide a lot of additional functionality that regular CSS does not. Some of the advantages of using preprocessors are:
        - Variables
        - Nesting
        - Mixins
        - Functions
        - Inheritance
        - Modularity

3. **Why choose Sass?**
    - Sass is the most popular CSS preprocessor. It is stable, powerful, and easy to learn. It has a large community and a lot of resources available online.

4. **Characteristics of Sass that make it a great choice:**
    - Sass has a lot of features that make it a great choice for a CSS preprocessor. Some of the characteristics of Sass are:
        - Variables
        - Nesting
        - Mixins
        - Functions
        - Inheritance
        - Modularity

5. **What is Nesting and why to use it?**
    - Nesting is a feature of Sass that allows you to nest CSS selectors within one another. This makes your code more readable and maintainable.

6. **Example of Nesting use in Sass:**
    ```scss
    .container {
        width: 100%;
        .header {
            background-color: #333;
            color: #fff;
        }
        .content {
            padding: 20px;
        }
    }
    ```

7. **What are Variables in Sass and why to use them?**
    - Variables in Sass are used to store information that you want to reuse throughout your stylesheet. They make your code more maintainable and easier to update.

8. **What are Mixins in Sass and why to use them?**
    - Mixins in Sass are reusable blocks of code that can be included in other styles. They allow you to reuse code and make your stylesheets more modular.

9. **Example of Mixins use in Sass:**
    ```scss
    @mixin border-radius($radius) {
        -webkit-border-radius: $radius;
        -moz-border-radius: $radius;
        border-radius: $radius;
    }
    ```
10. **How to use Sass Parameters in Mixins?**
    - Mixins in Sass can take parameters that allow you to customize their behavior. This makes your mixins more flexible and reusable.

11. **Can I use Mixins inside Mixins in Sass?**
    - Yes, you can use mixins inside mixins in Sass. This allows you to create more complex styles by combining multiple mixins together.

12. **What are Extends in Sass and why to use them?**
    - Extends in Sass allow you to share styles between selectors. This makes your code more maintainable and reduces duplication.

13. **Placeholder Classes with Extends in Sass:**
    - Placeholder classes in Sass are classes that are not compiled into CSS unless they are extended. This allows you to create reusable styles that are only included when needed.

14. **Difference between @extend and @include in Sass:**
    - The @extend directive in Sass is used to share styles between selectors, while the @include directive is used to include mixins in your styles.

15. **Apply proprieties in Sass with @extend:**
    - The @extend directive in Sass allows you to apply properties from one selector to another. 

15. **When to apply Extend besides normal classes in Sass?**
    - You can use the @extend directive in Sass to apply styles from one selector to another when you want to share styles between them.

16. **Use Variables for Colors and Dimensions in Sass:**
    - Variables in Sass are a great way to store colors and dimensions that you want to reuse throughout your stylesheet.

17. **Avoid Excessive Nesting in Sass:**
    - While nesting in Sass can make your code more readable, excessive nesting can lead to specificity issues and make your code harder to maintain.
