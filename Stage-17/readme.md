## Introduction
In this guide, we will explore how to create interactive websites using the Document Object Model (DOM) and event handling in JavaScript.

## Understanding the DOM
The DOM is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content.

## Manipulating the DOM
JavaScript provides several methods to manipulate the DOM, such as `getElementById`, `querySelector`, `createElement`, and `appendChild`.

## Event Handling
Events are actions that occur when the user interacts with the web page. JavaScript can respond to these events using event listeners.

## Examples
Here are some examples of DOM manipulation and event handling:

```javascript
// Example of DOM manipulation
const element = document.getElementById('myElement');
element.textContent = 'Hello, World!';

// Example of event handling
const button = document.querySelector('button');
button.addEventListener('click', () => {
    alert('Button was clicked!');
});
```

## Conclusion
Understanding and manipulating the DOM, along with handling events, are essential skills for creating interactive web applications.
