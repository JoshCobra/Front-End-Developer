## Overview
Responsive design is a design approach that allows web pages to be viewed on a variety of devices and window or screen sizes. The goal is to provide an optimal viewing experience for the user, regardless of the device they are using. This is achieved by using a combination of flexible grids, layouts, images, and CSS media queries.

## Media Queries
Media queries are a feature of CSS that allow you to apply different styles based on the device or screen size. This allows you to create a responsive design that looks good on a variety of devices, from desktop computers to smartphones and tablets.

## Responsive Containers
Responsive containers are a key component of responsive design. They allow you to create fluid layouts that adjust to the size of the screen or device. This ensures that your content looks good and is easy to read, regardless of the screen size.
