    **Internet** <-> **Internet Proveedor** -> **DNS Server** <- **Server**
    1. You (*client*) send the signal to your Internet Proveedor
    2. Internet Proveedor sends the information to the DNS Server(DNS is a website director)
    3. The server search for the `ip` direction in its database
    4. When the `IP` is identified the server sends it to you 



3. **Analyze the infrastructure of the internet and its story**  
    ### What is the World Wide Web?
    It is a system of interconnected web pages accessible on the internet, the way that the information is transferred is for the protocol `HTTP`

    ### What is `HTTP`

    (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the base of web functioning, its protocol is **server - client**

    - Is based on requests and responses
    - The browser reads the archives and shows them on the web page 
    - The archives received principally are, `HTML` `CSS` `JavaScript`
