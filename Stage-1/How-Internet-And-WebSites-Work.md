    **Internet** <-> **Internet Proveedor** -> **DNS Server** <- **Server**
    1. You (*client*) send the signal to your Internet Proveedor
    2. Internet Proveedor sends the information to the DNS Server(DNS is basically a website director)
    3. The sever search for the `ip` direction in its data base
    4. When the `ip` its identified the servers sends it to you 



3. **Analyze the infrastructure of internet and its story**  
    ### What is the World Wide Web?
    Its a system of interconnected of web pages accesible on the internet, the way that the information is transferred is for the protocol `HTTP`

    ### What is `HTTP`

    - Is based in requests and responses
    - The browser read the archives and shows them in the web page
