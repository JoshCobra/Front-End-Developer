# Setting Up The Indispensable Tools 

1. Web Browser that allows you to inspect, the ones that I recommend are, **Chrome**, **Edge**, **Arc**
    with this **inspect** tool =, were gonna be able to explore the structures of web pages 
    quick command to open: 
    ```
    MacOS: cmd+shift+c  

    Windows: ctrl+shift+c
    ```

2. Visual Studio Code (Code Editor)

    For many of us this is the **best code editor** but feel free to choose one that you're familiarized with.

    Some of the best features of Visual Studio Code include:

    - **IntelliSense**: Provides smart completions based on variable types, function definitions, and imported modules.
    - **Debugging**: Built-in debugging tools to help you diagnose and fix issues quickly.
    - **Extensions**: A vast library of extensions to add functionality and customize your development environment.
    - **Integrated Terminal**: Access the command line directly within the editor.
    - **Version Control**: Seamless integration with Git and other version control systems.
    - **Customization**: Highly customizable with themes, keybindings, and settings to suit your workflow.
    - **Live Share**: Collaborate with others in real-time, sharing your code and debugging sessions.

    These features make Visual Studio Code a powerful and versatile tool for developers.
