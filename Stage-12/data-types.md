# JavaScript Data Types

JavaScript is a versatile language used extensively in web development. Understanding its data types is crucial for writing efficient and bug-free code. Here are the primary data types in JavaScript:

## Primitive Data Types

1. **Number**
    - Represents both integer and floating-point numbers.
    - Example: `let age = 30;`, `let price = 19.99;`

2. **String**
    - Represents a sequence of characters.
    - Example: `let name = "John Doe";`

3. **Boolean**
    - Represents a logical entity and can have two values: `true` or `false`.
    - Example: `let isActive = true;`

4. **Undefined**
    - A variable that has been declared but not assigned a value.
    - Example: `let x;`

5. **Null**
    - Represents the intentional absence of any object value.
    - Example: `let y = null;`

6. **Symbol** (ES6)
    - A unique and immutable primitive value.
    - Example: `let sym = Symbol('description');`

7. **BigInt** (ES11)
    - Represents integers with arbitrary precision.
    - Example: `let bigInt = 1234567890123456789012345678901234567890n;`

## Non-Primitive Data Types

1. **Object**
    - A collection of properties, where each property is a key-value pair.
    - Example: `let person = { name: "John", age: 30 };`

## Use in Web Development

- **Dynamic Content**: JavaScript data types are used to manipulate and display dynamic content on web pages.
- **Form Validation**: Validate user input by checking data types.
- **APIs and AJAX**: Handle data from APIs, often in JSON format, which maps to JavaScript objects.
- **Event Handling**: Use boolean values to manage event states and conditions.
- **Local Storage**: Store and retrieve data in the browser using strings and objects.

Understanding these data types and their uses is fundamental for effective web development with JavaScript.
