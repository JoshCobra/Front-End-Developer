# Font family Proprieties in CSS

Visualize the [Example](/Stage-4/documents/Propieties/)

The `font-family` property in CSS is used to specify the font of the text. You can specify a list of fonts separated by commas, and the browser will use the first font in the list that is available on the user's system.

[] Note: If the font name contains spaces, it must be enclosed in quotes.
[] Note: If the font name is not available, the browser will use the default font for that system.
[] Note: The suggested VsCode font-families are called safe-fonts, which are fonts that are available on most systems.

[] Note: You can add font-families from the web using the referring link to the font-family.
