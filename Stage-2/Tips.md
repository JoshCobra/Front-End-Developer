# TIPS 

## Consistent Indentation:

- Follow consistent indentation practices to improve code readability.

- Use indentation spaces for each level of elements within your HTML structure, making it easier to understand the document’s hierarchy.

## Attention to Titles:

- Pay attention to your HTML page’s title using the `<title>` tag.

- Be clear and descriptive when choosing a title, as it will appear on the browser tab and is important for user experience.

## Good Documentation Practices:

- Document your code as you go, explaining the purpose of each section and the use of tags.

## Semantic Tag Usage:

- Use heading tags `(<h1>, <h2>, etc.)` semantically to indicate the hierarchy of your titles. Only use one `<h1>` per page and arrange the other headers hierarchically.

- Assign meaningful names to tags and attributes to make their purpose clearer. For example, use `<div id="links">` instead of `<div id="section1">`.

## Alt Attribute for Accessibility:

- Include the alt attribute in all image tags `(<img>)`. 
- Provide concise and meaningful descriptions to help visually impaired users or in case images fail to load.

## `<span>` Tag for Highlighting Text:

- Use the `<span>` tag to highlight or differentiate specific parts of text. 
- Even if no specific styles are applied in this example, `<span>` can be styled later with CSS to format that content.

## Using Emmet:

- Take advantage of Emmet to quickly generate the basic HTML structure. This speeds up the coding process and enhances efficiency.

## `<caption>` Tag:

- Use the `<caption>` tag to provide a descriptive title for your table. This improves accessibility and helps users better understand the content of the table.

## Accessibility:

- Ensure your table is accessible by providing appropriate descriptions, using scope attributes, and correctly marking table headers.

## Using Semantic Tags:

- Use semantic tags like `<form>`, `<label>`, `<input>`, `<select>`, and `<textarea>` to meaningfully structure your form. This improves both accessibility and SEO.

## Validation Attributes:

- Utilize attributes like required for fields that must be completed. This aids in client-side validation before sending data to the server.
Using the `<label>` Tag:

- Always use the `<label>` tag associated with each field to enhance accessibility and user experience. 
- Associate each `<label>` with its corresponding `<input>` using the for attribute.

## Using the `<fieldset>` Tag:

- To group related sets of fields, use the `<fieldset>` tag. This helps organize and visually structure the form.
