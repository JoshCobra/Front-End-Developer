# Final Website

Finally according to all we learn from the Stage-2 we create our first complex website, using images, forms, tables, multiple pages, multiple headings, different types of inputs, this is my example:

- [My Website](/Stage-2/documents/my-website-html/index.html)

<div align="center">

[Intro Stage-2](/Stage-2/) --- [Go Back](/Stage-2/Forms-in-HTML.md)  ---  [Next](/Stage-2/Tips.md)

</div>
