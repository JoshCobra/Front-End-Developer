# The REAL FIRST Page

We are going to set our first page using the concepts of the [Basic Syntax](/Stage-2/Basic-Syntax-in-HTML.md)

## Step 1
First set the bases of the `html` format

## Step 2
Now in the section `<body> </body>` is where we are going to enter all the things we want our page to have, refer to: [Basic Syntax](/Stage-2/Basic-Syntax-in-HTML.md)

#### Divisions `(<div>)`:

- `<div>` elements are used to group sections of content together. This is helpful for organizing content and applying CSS styles later.

#### Headings `(<h1>, <h2>, <h3>)`:

- `<h1>`: Main heading of the webpage, which is usually the largest text.

- `<h2>`: Sub-heading, slightly smaller than `<h1>`.

- `<h3>`: Tertiary heading, even smaller.

Headings are crucial for structuring content, making it more accessible and easier to read.

Paragraphs `(<p>)`:
- Paragraphs are blocks of text that are wrapped inside `<p>` tags.

## Step 3

### In this section we use:

#### Links `(<a href="...">)`:

- `<a>` **(anchor tag):** Used to create hyperlinks. The `href` attribute specifies the URL of the page the link goes to.

- The first link points to an external website.

- The second link `(href="rules.html")` points to another page within the same website.

#### Lists `(<ul> and <ol>)`:

- `<ul>`: An unordered list where items are typically marked with bullets.

- `<ol>`: An ordered list where items are numbered.

- `<li>`: List item inside either a `<ul>` or `<ol>`.

#### Images `(<img src="...">)`:

-  `<img>`: Used to embed images in the webpage.

    The `src` attribute specifies the path to the image:

    - First image uses an absolute URL (a full link to an image online).

    - The second and third images use a relative URL, pointing to images located in the local folder (img/).

    `alt`: Provides a description of the image if it fails to load or for screen readers (important for accessibility).

#### Span Element `(<span>)`:

- `<span>` is used to group inline elements. Unlike `<div>`, which is a block-level element, `<span>` does not create a new block but is used to apply styles or manipulate specific parts of inline text.

### Step 4

This is the second page created just to do an example of the use of: `<a href=" ">`
