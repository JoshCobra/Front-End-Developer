# What is HTML?

HTML **(HyperText Markup Language)** is the standard language used to create and structure content on the web. 
It defines the elements and structure of a webpage, such as headings, paragraphs, links, images, and more.

### Here’s a breakdown of its key aspects:

- **HyperText:** Refers to the system of linking text, allowing users to navigate between different webpages by clicking on hyperlinks.
- **Markup Language:** Refers to the way HTML uses tags to "mark up" content to define its structure and presentation.
  
### How HTML Works:

HTML uses tags (enclosed in angle brackets < >) to define different elements on a webpage. For example:

- `<h1>`: Represents a heading.
- `<p>`: Represents a paragraph.
- `<a>`: Represents a link.
- `<img>`: Represents an image.

These tags tell the browser how to display the content. HTML provides the basic framework of a webpage, which is then styled with CSS and made interactive with JavaScript.

Here's a simple example of HTML code:

```html
Copiar código
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My Webpage</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Welcome to My Webpage</h1>
    <p>This is a simple paragraph of text.</p>
    <a href="https://www.example.com">Click here to visit example.com</a>
  </body>
</html>
```
In this example, HTML defines the structure of the webpage, including a heading (`<h1>`), a paragraph (`<p>`), and a hyperlink (`<a>`).
