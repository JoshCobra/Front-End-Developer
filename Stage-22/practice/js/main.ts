//To compile, go to the terminal, and in the folder of the archive select the archive and execute the next command:
// tsc {archive.ts}

// And just like that automatically, typescript exports your archive and transforms to an dot js file

// We can also use the command tsc {archive-name.ts} -watch to compile in real time
