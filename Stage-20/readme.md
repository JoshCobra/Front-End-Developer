# AJAX and APIs

## Introduction

AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) is a web development technique for creating interactive applications. It allows web pages to be updated asynchronously by exchanging small amounts of data with the server behind the scenes. This means that parts of a web page can be updated without reloading the entire page.

## What is an API?

An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules that allows software to communicate with each other. In the context of web development, APIs are used to enable web applications to interact with external services, such as databases, third-party services, etc.

## Using AJAX with APIs

To use AJAX with APIs, the following flow is generally followed:

1. **Create an XMLHttpRequest**: This object allows data to be exchanged with a web server.
2. **Configure the request**: Specify the HTTP method (GET, POST, etc.) and the API URL.
3. **Send the request**: Send the request to the server.
4. **Handle the response**: Process the server's response when it is available.

### Example of using AJAX with an API

```javascript
// Create a new request
let xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();

// Configure the request
xhr.open('GET', 'https://api.example.com/data', true);

// Handle the response
xhr.onreadystatechange = function() {
    if (xhr.readyState === 4 && xhr.status === 200) {
        let data = JSON.parse(xhr.responseText);
        console.log(data);
    }
};

// Send the request
xhr.send();
```
