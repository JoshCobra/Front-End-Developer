# HTML Entities

HTML entities are used to display reserved characters in HTML. They are also used to display characters that cannot be typed from the keyboard.

## Common HTML Entities

| Character | Entity Name | Entity Number |
|-----------|--------------|---------------|
| `&`       | `&amp;`      | `&#38;`       |
| `<`       | `&lt;`       | `&#60;`       |
| `>`       | `&gt;`       | `&#62;`       |
| `"`       | `&quot;`     | `&#34;`       |
| `'`       | `&apos;`     | `&#39;`       |

## Example Usage

```html
<p>Use &lt; and &gt; to represent the less than and greater than signs.</p>
```

This will render as:

```html
<p>Use < and > to represent the less than and greater than signs.</p>
```
