# Diversity in HTML

HTML provides a variety of tags to structure and format content on the web. One such tag is the `<b>` tag.

By using these tags appropriately, you can enhance the readability and visual appeal of your web content.

## The `<b>` Tag

The `<b>` tag is used to make text bold. It is a physical markup tag that does not convey any extra importance or emphasis, but simply renders the text in bold.

### Example

```html
<p>This is a <b>bold</b> statement.</p>
```

### Output

This is a **bold** statement.

## Usage

While the `<b>` tag is useful for styling text, it is important to use it appropriately. For conveying importance or emphasis, consider using the `<strong>` or `<em>` tags instead.

## The `<i>` Tag

The `<i>` tag is used to italicize text. It is a physical markup tag that does not convey any extra importance or emphasis, but simply renders the text in italics.

### Example

```html
<p>This is an <i>italicized</i> word.</p>
```

### Output

This is an *italicized* word.

## The `<u>` Tag

The `<u>` tag is used to underline text. It is a physical markup tag that does not convey any extra importance or emphasis, but simply renders the text with an underline.

### Example

```html
<p>This is an <u>underlined</u> word.</p>
```

### Output

This is an <u>underlined</u> word.

## The `<mark>` Tag

The `<mark>` tag is used to highlight text. It is a semantic markup tag that indicates that the text is of special relevance.

### Example

```html
<p>This is a <mark>highlighted</mark> word.</p>
```

### Output

This is a <mark>highlighted</mark> word.

### Example with `<strong>`

```html
<p>This is a <strong>very important</strong> statement.</p>
```

### Example with `<em>`

```html
<p>This is an <em>emphasized</em> statement.</p>
```

### Output

This is a **very important** statement.

This is an *emphasized* statement.

By understanding and using these tags correctly, you can create more meaningful and accessible web content.
