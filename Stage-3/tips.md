<h1> TIPS</h1>

Block-level elements can contain any type of element, whether block-level or inline. You can use this strategically to structure your content.

Avoid nesting inline elements within block-level elements. Following proper nesting rules improves code readability and helps prevent unexpected behavior.

Be mindful of the behavior of inline elements like `<img>` and `<input>`. Adjust their styles and layout according to the design needs.

Use `<br>` to force line breaks where necessary. However, excessive use of it may affect the structure and presentation of the content.

Utilize comments (`<!-- ... -->`) to explain your code. This is particularly helpful for remembering the purpose of certain sections or leaving notes for other developers to review the code.

Break your page into logical sections using appropriate tags. For example, use `<header>` for the header, `<nav>` for navigation, `<article>` for independent content, and `<footer>` for the footer.

Ensure you optimize your code for multimedia elements. You can use tools and methods to minimize redundant code and improve website performance.
