    <h1>Entities in HTML</h1>
    <p>Here are some common entities that you may encounter in HTML:</p>
    <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/named-characters.html">HTML Character Entities</a>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Character</th>
            <th>Entity</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>&lt;</td>
            <td>&amp;lt;</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>&gt;</td>
            <td>&amp;gt;</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
