# What is Node.js?

Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to run JavaScript code outside of a web browser. It is built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, which compiles JavaScript code into machine code, making it fast and efficient. Node.js is primarily used for building server-side applications and is known for its event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, which makes it suitable for building scalable and high-performance applications.

Key features of Node.js include:
- **Asynchronous and Event-Driven**: Node.js uses an event-driven architecture, allowing it to handle multiple connections simultaneously without blocking the execution of code.
- **Single-Threaded**: Although Node.js operates on a single thread, it can handle many concurrent connections through its event loop and callback functions.
- **NPM (Node Package Manager)**: Node.js comes with NPM, a powerful package manager that allows developers to easily install, share, and manage libraries and dependencies for their projects.
- **Cross-Platform**: Node.js can run on various operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- **Rich Ecosystem**: Node.js has a vast ecosystem of libraries and frameworks, making it easier for developers to build applications quickly.

Node.js is widely used for building web servers, APIs, real-time applications (like chat applications), and microservices. Its ability to handle a large number of simultaneous connections with high throughput makes it a popular choice for modern web development.
