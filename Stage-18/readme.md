jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library. It makes things like HTML document traversal and manipulation, event handling, and animation much simpler with an easy-to-use API that works across a multitude of browsers. With a combination of versatility and extensibility, jQuery has changed the way that millions of people write JavaScript.

## Getting Started
There are a few ways to get started with jQuery. You can:   
1. Install jQuery through npm: `npm install jquery`
2. Include jQuery from a CDN, like so:   
```html
<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.5.1.min.js"></script>
```
3. Download the compressed, production jQuery file from the jQuery website.

## Usage
You can use jQuery to manipulate the DOM, handle events, and add effects. Here's an example of how you can use jQuery to hide an element when it is clicked:

```javascript
$(document).ready(function(){
    $("p").click(function(){
        $(this).hide();
    });
});
```
